3D Scene in OpenGL
# How do I approach designing software?
I begin my design process by choosing a scene by taking a picture or finding an image online that I want to recreate. Then, I begin with the basic OpenGL setup in Visual Studio by including the proper libraries, etc. I then begin creating my basic shapes without texture and placing them where I want them to be. Once all shapes are in the proper location, I will add in camera movement, as well as texture and lighting shaders. 
# How do I approach developing programs?
This project helped me learn how to begin from scratch and build up a 3D scene using OpenGL. I learned that there is a lot of planning that is involved, so I must make sure to begin the development and testing of my code early on. One strategy that I developed while working on this project was to make a "backup" file which will hold code that works properly for the previous task, almost like a checkpoint save. This allows me to edit my code and test the adjustments without worrying about making a mistake which would take hours to fix. 
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This course was the first class in which we created anything 3D. I think this was very beneficial to learn how to create an interactive, 3D environment. I am interested in developing games, so this could be beneficial in the future if I go that route.
